Trying Ensembl BioMart
1.Try the "count" button. Ensembl should respond by claiming it has 63,967 genes for human (as of 2017-11-24). 
You get this many genes because Ensembl has included RNA genes and pseudogenes. 
- Get 63967

2. How many unique protein-coding genes are there then? Use filters to list those genes that have the type "protein coding".
-22375 protein coding genes. (Gene ->Gene type)

3. How many of the protein coding genes have been assigned an ID by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)? (There should be fewer than in the previous question.)
-21579 protein coding genes with the HGNC ID (Gene -> Limit to genes(external references)

4. How many genes have an orthologue in mouse? Use the homologue filter. 
-17733 Genes, with the previous filters still on.  (Multi Species Comparison -> Homologue Filter)
-19949 Genes, with the previous filters off.

Downloading Sequences. (Protein Domains and Families -> Limit to genes with these....) (Gene ->Gene type) Gives 53 genes. (Attributes -> Sequences)
1. Fasta.

2. Unspliced transcript: mRNA not spliced. You get all isoforms. 
Unspliced Gene: Gene not spliced, and you do not get all different isoforms.

3. unspliced transcript: Unspliced mRNA
cDNA: mRNA that has been reverse transcribed into DNA. get isoforms. 

4. 230 sequences. Different isoforms. (ctrl + f ">")
